# A-A-B-test-project
The data in this project show the behavior of selected users on the website of a startup company that sells food products. These data were sampled during the AAB test. The goal of this project is to determine whether a redesign of the font on the site will improve the company's sales. For this purpose, the users are divided into 3 groups, 2 control groups and a test group. For the control groups the site is presented unchanged, while for the test group the site is presented with the new fonts.  In the project I will investigate the order of actions of the users on the site and the conversion rate of each of the groups. Using the findings I will draw conclusions about redesigning the site.
